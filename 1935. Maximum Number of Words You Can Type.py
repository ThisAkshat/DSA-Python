1935. Maximum Number of Words You Can Type

There is a malfunctioning keyboard where some letter keys do not work. All other keys on the keyboard work properly.

Given a string text of words separated by a single space (no leading or trailing spaces) and a string brokenLetters of
all distinct letter keys that are broken, return the number of words in text you can fully type using this keyboard.

 

Example 1:
Input: text = "hello world", brokenLetters = "ad"
Output: 1
Explanation: We cannot type "world" because the 'd' key is broken.

Example 2:
Input: text = "leet code", brokenLetters = "lt"
Output: 1
Explanation: We cannot type "leet" because the 'l' and 't' keys are broken.

Example 3:
Input: text = "leet code", brokenLetters = "e"
Output: 0
Explanation: We cannot type either word because the 'e' key is broken.
