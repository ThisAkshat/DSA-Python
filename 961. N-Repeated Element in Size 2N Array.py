961. N-Repeated Element in Size 2N Array
Solved
You are given an integer array nums with the following properties:

nums.length == 2 * n.
nums contains n + 1 unique values, n of which occur exactly once in the array.
Exactly one element of nums is repeated n times.
Return the element that is repeated n times.

 

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,3]
Output: 3

Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,1,2,5,3,2]
Output: 2

Example 3:
Input: nums = [5,1,5,2,5,3,5,4]
Output: 5
